# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The DataTrace application is experiencing persistent deployment failures on Railway due to Docker build context issues, specifically with npm ci failing to find package-lock.json files. This spec addresses the systematic resolution of Railway deployment configuration, Docker build optimization, and alternative deployment strategies to ensure reliable production deployment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Docker Build Context Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Docker build process to correctly locate and use package-lock.json files, so that npm ci can install dependencies successfully on Railway.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Docker build runs on Railway THEN the package-lock.json file SHALL be accessible to npm ci commands
2. WHEN copying package files in Dockerfile THEN both package.json and package-lock.json SHALL be copied from the correct backend directory path
3. WHEN the build context is the root directory THEN the Dockerfile SHALL use correct relative paths to access backend files
4. IF package-lock.json is missing THEN the build process SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback strategies

### Requirement 2: Railway Configuration Optimization

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want Railway to build and deploy the backend service efficiently, so that deployment time is minimized and resource usage is optimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Railway starts a deployment THEN it SHALL use the correct Dockerfile path and build context
2. WHEN building the Docker image THEN Railway SHALL have sufficient memory and timeout settings for npm operations
3. WHEN the build completes THEN Railway SHALL successfully start the Node.js application on the specified port
4. IF build failures occur THEN Railway SHALL provide detailed logs for debugging

### Requirement 3: Build Process Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build process to be resilient to network issues and resource constraints, so that deployments succeed consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN npm install runs THEN it SHALL use offline-first strategies and skip unnecessary operations
2. WHEN memory constraints are encountered THEN the build process SHALL optimize resource usage
3. WHEN network issues occur THEN npm operations SHALL retry with cached packages
4. WHEN the build takes too long THEN timeout settings SHALL be appropriate for the build complexity

### Requirement 4: Alternative Deployment Strategy

**User Story:** As a developer, I want backup deployment options if Docker builds continue to fail, so that the application can still be deployed to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Docker builds fail repeatedly THEN alternative deployment methods SHALL be available
2. WHEN using buildpack deployment THEN the Node.js application SHALL build and start correctly
3. WHEN switching deployment strategies THEN environment variables and configuration SHALL be preserved
4. IF Railway deployment fails THEN other cloud platforms SHALL be evaluated as alternatives

### Requirement 5: Build Monitoring and Debugging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring of the build process, so that I can quickly identify and resolve deployment issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN builds fail THEN detailed error logs SHALL be captured and analyzed
2. WHEN debugging build issues THEN file system state SHALL be inspectable at each build step
3. WHEN optimizing builds THEN build time and resource usage metrics SHALL be tracked
4. WHEN builds succeed THEN success metrics SHALL be recorded for comparison

### Requirement 6: Production Environment Configuration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the production environment to be properly configured with security, monitoring, and performance optimizations, so that the application runs reliably in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL run as a non-root user for security
2. WHEN health checks run THEN they SHALL accurately report application status
3. WHEN environment variables are set THEN they SHALL be appropriate for production use
4. WHEN the application receives requests THEN it SHALL respond correctly on the configured port
